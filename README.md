This repository has code, and some underlying data used to create the figures in this manuscript, please reference the manuscript and supplement for further details. The contents of this repository are as follows: 
1-	Ranefs_bayesian_COMSA.R is the code used to run the logistic regression analysis shown in Figure 4 of the main text as well as the Bayesian implementation of the random effects model and subsequent calculation of the vulnerability scores  shown in Figure 5A of the main text. 
2-	Ranks_corelation_analysis.R is the code used to generate the correlation analysis between the vulnerability scores and the antigen specific cluster ranks in Figure 5C. 
3-	Map_clusters.R is the code used to generate the map of Zambezia with ranked vulnerability scores in Figure 5B. 
4-	Comsa_CDC_cutoffs.R is the code used to generate the cutoff values for the NTDs as well as the ROC analysis in supplementary Figure 6. 
5-	Comsa_figures_updated27Feb2024_combinedPanel.R is the code used to generate seroprevalence estimates shown in Figure 2. 
6-	For_Andrea_gam_updated26Sept2023_agemonths.R and Figure_3.R are code files used to fit the GAMs, perform the bootstrap procedure for the estimate of model parameters and predicted seroprevalence, and to convert the results into the plots shown in Figure 3 of the main text.
